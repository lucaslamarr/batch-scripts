A collection of Batch file scripts that I have created and added to my workflow.

1. ```build.bat``` - Builds any C files that exist within the source folder using GCC and links libraries for getting started with Windows development. If you do not already have a build folder next to the source folder, running this file will create one. If no errors are found, the program will run after finishing the build.
2. ```count.bat``` - Searches the source folder and displays the number of lines next to each file's name of the specified file type(s) and also shows the total lines in the entire source folder. 
3. ```todo.bat``` - Searches the source folder and displays any instances of "TODO" found within a comment and provides information about what file and line it exists on, as well as the contents of that line.
